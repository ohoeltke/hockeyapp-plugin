By entering a comma-separated list of tags here, you can restrict downloads of your app to only users/devices with these tags.<br/>
You can include build variables here like <code>${BUILD_NUMBER}</code> and they'll be expanded at build time.<br/>
If this field is blank, no such restrictions will be applied to the uploaded app.
