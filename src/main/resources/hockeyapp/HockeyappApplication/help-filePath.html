You can include build variables here like <code>${BUILD_NUMBER}</code> and they'll be expanded at build time.

e.g. "MyApp/build/Beta-iphoneos/MyApp-Beta-${BUILD_NUMBER}.ipa if your use ${BUILD_NUMBER} as technical version number (CFBundleShortVersionString).

Can use wildcards like 'module/dist/**/*.ipa'.
